Prediction-of-user-churn
MIPT DeepLearningSchool task

This competition is a homework assignment for the 3rd module of the advanced DLS stream (Spring 2021)

You will have to learn how to simulate the outflow of telecom company customers. This task is very important in practice and algorithms for its solution are used in real telecom companies, because if we know that a client is going to leave us, then we will try to keep him by offering some bonuses.

On the data page, you can upload two files - train.csv (contains feature columns and the target variable) and test.csv (contains only feature columns).

As an answer, you need to upload predictions of the probabilities of clients leaving for test.csv. An example of a file with presets is submission.csv.

The names of the signs and the target variable are in the baseline notebook. (baseline is the basic solution that more advanced algorithms are usually compared to.)
